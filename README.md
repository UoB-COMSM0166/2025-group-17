## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

### Requirements 

<!-- - 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop? -->

<!-- Reflection on requirement engineering -->
During the workshop in Week 4, we explored the process of requirement engineering by identifying various stakeholders and determining their expectations. To estimate the user value of our game, we utilized the onion model to hierarchically consider stakeholders and gather potential requirements beyond our team's initial scope. Outlining the epics and user stories helps us break them into smaller, manageable tasks, specifying what the team should build in each sprint cycle. This approach ensures clear and measurable requirements, detailing the time and effort required from the development team. By assigning smaller tasks to each team member, we minimize the impact of adjustments, keeping our team agile and adaptable. We also consider the diverse needs of different users, which allows each team member to focus on independent and achievable goals, thereby reducing the risk associated with complex objectives. The acceptance criteria are crucial for identifying deliverable outcomes and prioritizing solutions that work for most people. Furthermore, communicating requirements within the team enhances our ability to gather feedback among the team members and reflect on changes before modifying the actual code. With the help of it, we can be more flexible to the demands that change frequently, which fits the spirit of agile development.

#### Epic and User Stories
**Epic 1: Players with different gaming experiences**

As a player,
I want to get inspired and relax during the gameplay,
so that I can enjoy the game regardless of my previous gaming experiences.

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| As a **casual player**, I want to save my game progress frequently, so that I can return to play without losing significant progress. | Given the player reaches the end of each sub-level, When the player passes by a save point, Then the game saves the current progress and provides a confirmation message. |
| As an **explorer player**, I want to explore all the easter eggs and gain all the achievements, so that I can explore every interesting aspect and experience of this game. | Given the player reaches the optional challenge level/room, When the player beats all the enemies in this room, Then they would gain different skill sets or bonus points. |
| As a **competitive player**, I want to see trackers for my performance, so that I can compare with other players. | Given the player completes all the levels, When the end screen is displayed and the user enters their username, Then the playerâ€™s name and score are shown along with their rank on the leaderboard for that level.
| As a **new player**, I want to learn the basic controls and terminologies, so that I can quickly learn how to play without frustration. | Given the game is started for the first time, When the user selects "New Game", Then an interactive tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on moving, jumping, and collecting items. |
| As a **story seeker**, I want to meet all the items and unlock all the elements of the game. | Given the player has finished all the levels, When every time play the game, Then new grap of the game will be achieved. |

**Note**: The potential stakeholders are marked as **bolded** above.

### Design

- 15% ~750 words 
- System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams. 

### Implementation

- 15% ~750 words

- Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game. 

### Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words

- One qualitative evaluation (your choice) 

Heuristic Evaluation

| Name | Interface | Issue | Heuristic(s) | Freguency 0 (rare) to 4 (common) | Impact 0 (easy) to difficult (4) | Persistence 0 (once) to 4 (repeated) | Severity = Sum Total of F+I+P/3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Hsinyun Fan | Tutorial Interface | Don't know when player is attacked by enemies. | Visibility of system status | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1.25 |
| Kailin Fang | Tutorial Interface | Instruction could be more clear (like use picture to show). | Help and documentation | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1.33 |
| Daisy Fan | Tutorial Interface | Can pop up instruction first then begin. The HP not very clear. | Help and documentation | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1.33 |
| Brian | Tutorial Interface | Don't know how to win or play when just eneter the game. | Visibility | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 |
| Kaijie Xu | "Playing" Interface | Player identification | Recognition rather than recall. | 2 | 2 | 4 | 2.67 |
| Kaijie Xu | "Playing" Interface | Differentiation mechanism | User control and freedom. | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1.67 |


- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice) 

- Description of how code was tested. 

### Process 

- 15% ~750 words

- Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together. 

### Conclusion

- 10% ~500 words

- Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work. 

### Contribution Statement

- Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent. 

### Additional Marks

You can delete this section in your own repo, it's just here for information. in addition to the marks above, we will be marking you on the following two points:
