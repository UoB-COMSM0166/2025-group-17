| Hong Jin | 2D Platformer | Use voice as a control method. The character's jump height is controlled by the volume of the player's voice. To support keyboard/mouse operations at the same time, the volume determines whether the character performs a jump or a high jump. | <ul><li> **Character size**: Character can shrink to reach places normally inaccessible using certain items. The camera can start with a full view of the map and then switch to follow the character to increase the difficulty of collecting items and enhance player immersion. </li><br><li> **Scene Changes**: Random events or temporary abilitiy enhancements when moving to the next map or passing a save point. Three random options for the player to choose from each time for player's engagement and anticipation. </li></ul> | YASUHATI |
|Fruit Merge|Puzzle games|Merge Fruits is a casual merging game that lets you drop fruits and combine identical ones to whip up new and exciting blends. When the same fruits collide, they merge into a larger fruit. Your mission is to smartly pair the same types of fruits to make the biggest possible fruits.| 1. Merging Mechanism: Players start with basic fruits (like apples or bananas) and merge two identical fruits to create a higher-value fruit (e.g., combining two apples to make an orange). The goal is to keep merging fruits and advancing to more valuable fruits to score higher or achieve in-game objectives. 2. Limited Spaces: The game typically takes place on a grid or a board where fruits are placed.  Players have a limited space to make merges, and as the game progresses, the space may become crowded. Some games may introduce obstacles or limited moves, adding to the challenge of creating higher-level fruits. 3.Resource Management: In many versions of the game, players need to manage the available fruits and space wisely to avoid running out of moves or room for new merges. Players may need to plan several moves ahead to avoid getting stuck with no available moves. |1. Power-ups and Boosters: Some versions of Fruit Merge include power-ups or boosters that help players by removing obstacles, adding more fruits to the board, or reshuffling the items to create new merging opportunities. These power-ups are typically earned through progression or can be purchased using in-game currency. 2. Levels and Objectives: The game may feature different levels, each with its own set of challenges or goals.  For example, players may need to create a certain number of high-level fruits or reach a specific score within a set number of moves. As players progress through the levels, the difficulty may increase, with more complex boards, fewer available moves, or harder-to-reach fruits. 3. Time Limits or Move Limits: Some versions of the game may have time limits for completing objectives, while others may give players a limited number of moves to complete a level. 4. Upgrades and Rewards: As players complete levels or challenges, they may unlock rewards such as new fruits, special abilities, or additional moves. Progression often leads to unlocking new types of fruits to merge, creating a sense of accomplishment and motivating players to keep playing. 5. Daily Challenges or Events:  Many games feature daily or special events where players can earn extra rewards, boosters, or new types of fruits by completing specific tasks or challenges.|
