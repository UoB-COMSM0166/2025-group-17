•	问题表现：
o	玩家不知道什么时候受到攻击。
o	血量显示不清晰，难以一眼看出。
o	子弹太慢，缺乏及时反馈。
o	怪物血量不可见。
•	影响：影响玩家对游戏状态的理解，容易导致挫败感。
•	建议改进：强化血条、攻击提示等 UI 元素，提升即时反馈。
2. 控制自由度和反馈不足（User Control and Freedom）

o	无法自由移动（如碰撞卡住、不能左右移动）。
o	游戏难度高，重启按钮难找。
o	保存机制不清晰。
•	影响：降低用户掌控感，容易流失玩家。
•	建议改进：提供清晰控制提示、自定义按键、明确的重试或退出按钮。

4. 界面一致性与审美问题（Consistency, Aesthetic and Minimalist Design）
•	问题表现：
o	按钮太小或不明显。
o	障碍物视觉与实际碰撞不一致。
o	怪物或障碍过快导致难以反应。
•	影响：降低界面易用性和可预测性。

•	问题表现：
o	玩家难以识别自己角色或游戏元素。
o	难以记住如何重启或继续游戏。
•	影响：玩家需要过多记忆，认知负担加重。
