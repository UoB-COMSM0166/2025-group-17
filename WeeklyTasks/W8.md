| User ID | I think I would like to use this system frequently | I found the system unnecessarily complex | I thought the system was easy to use | I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system | I found the various functions in this system were well integrated | I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system | I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly | I found the system very cumbersome to use | I felt very confident using the system | I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system |

Statistical testing: Wilcoxon sign-ranked test

Higher SUS scores indicate better perceived usability. The Easy Mode had higher usability scores than Hard Mode, suggesting that users found the game more intuitive and accessible in Easy Mode. 我们对 SUS 数据进行了 Wilcoxon 符号秩检验，结果显示出明显的显著性。对于一组 11 名参与者，计算出的 W 检验统计量为 5.5。使用已知值图表，这表明显著性水平达到 0.025，或者 97.5% 确定“简单”和“困难”选择之间存在实际差异。这种对工作量是否真的存在差异的不确定性与定性评估的结果之一有关，该结果显示玩家并不确定两种难度模式之间的差异是什么。

Easy模式和Hard模式的平均得分分别为 73.2 和 62.3。后者低于一般可用性基准 68。
根据上表结果，我们决定改善玩家的操控方式、类与类之间的碰撞逻辑以及非游戏界面的UI设计来提高困难模式系统的整体性and让玩家更容易掌握和熟练使用游戏系统。以期望使其达到68基准。
