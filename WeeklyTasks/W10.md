# Green Software Implementation Patterns Report

## Overview

This report evaluates the application of [Green Software Foundation's Implementation Patterns](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/catalog).

## Applied Green Patterns

### 1. Properly Sized Images
- Images (backgrounds, icons) are dynamically scaled using canvas size, e.g., `heightInPixel / 4`.
- Images are only drawn at the size they are displayed to reduce overfetching.
- Room backgrounds are loaded with specific sizes using `image(..., width, height)`.

### 2. Avoid Unused Assets
- Unused assets are commented out in `main.js` to avoid memory overhead:
```js
// obstacleImages.push(loadImage('.../pillow1.png'));
```

### 3. Conditional Rendering / Efficient Loops
- Main `draw()` function uses flags like `isGamePaused`, `menuDisplayed` to reduce rendering cost.
- Game elements like bullets/enemies are updated only when necessary.

### 4. Efficient Asset Management
- Preloaded audio and images in `preload()` for optimized reuse.
- Sound reuse using `.currentTime = 0` instead of reloading.

### 5. Use of Vector Math
- Movement logic uses `p5.Vector` for directions, interpolation, and scaling.
- Reduces unnecessary mathematical overhead.

### 6. Minimize Redundant DOM / UI Operations
- UI buttons are only shown/hidden when needed, instead of recreating.

## Summary Table

| Practice                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Properly Sized Images            | Canvas-based scaling |
| Avoid Unused Assets              | Commented-out unused assets |
| Conditional Rendering            | Logical UI/game state management |
| Efficient Asset Management       | Resource reuse |
| Use of Vector Math               | Efficient movement logic |
| Minimize Redundant DOM Ops       | `show()`/`hide()` vs recreate |

## Conclusion

The project already follows many of the green software development principles, especially in image optimization, resource handling, and performance-aware rendering. These practices contribute to energy-efficient, scalable, and sustainable web software.
